# Barrain

Barrain is an pedagogical game created for students aged 7 to 11 years. The goal of the game is to fill
the wall of a barrage by heliporting some pieces from a given production. The pedagogue can retrieve
the player’s performance data to evaluate its executive functions. It aims to be integrated into a
platform containing other serious educational games.
The name "Barrain" is a mix in "Barrage" and "Brain", which expresses the duality between the
complexity of the assembly of the barrage and the use of player’s cognitive resources.
